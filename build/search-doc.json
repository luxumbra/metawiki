We’ve recently received a small grant from the MetaCartel & have been pushing out updates. The latest version is live here. Discounting the fact that some of these things are still hardcoded, the live version is almost as good as the design demo we previewed 2 weeks ago. We had a live raid yesterday; introducing new members to the codebase and the old ones to the latest changes, brainstorming & co-hacking. So yeah, the raid has been progressing pretty good & the team has been growing. The basics are pretty much done and the design & the Discord bot we’ll use for the guild pages are both coming along nicely. 🧠 MetaLibraryIt's almost time to rebrand the wiki to the MetaLibrary - but not quite yet. To really make it into a MetaLibrary, we’ll need at least those “House of Ethereum”, “House of dApps”, “House of Tokens” & “House of Defiance” posts. Why aren’t those new posts there already? Well, because I have been revamping all the existing posts, writing the missing intro/onboarding pieces, and actually, spending ever more time inside DMs & chat channels responding to people - which is kind of becoming my frustration, as already stated above. 😅 🌱 Seed Market 💸I think it's safe to say MetaGame’s liquidity problem has successfully been dealt with. Seed price: ~$43 Seed marketcap: ~$600k In the liquidity pool: ~$74k Treasury funds used? ~$2/30k Frankly, the Seed market has been blowing up for the past few days. Though -50% from the all-time high of over $80, the Seed price seems to have somewhat stabilized at ~$40, which is still more than 4x just a week ago. If you’ve been useful around MetaGame, you likely have a decent sum now 🙃 📻 MetaRadioThe new podcast episode is out! Autonomous Genesis - Real World DAOs & Regenerative Economies You might notice it's called “Autonomous Genesis” and not “MetaView”. No, we haven’t rebranded the podcast - we launched a new podcast; two new podcasts to be more precise! 😱 You’re going to be funding 3 podcasts now? 👀 Not exactly, the idea with the Autonomous Podcast is that it will run & pay itself. Each new guest will interview the next guest as well as pay for the production cost of the next episode. The Autonomous Genesis will now branch into two podcast chains: Autonomous A - fixing the world with technology. Autonomous B - fixing the world with non-profits. 👕 MetaMerchThe store itself still isn’t up but we do have some fresh designs! Maybe start warming up for these drops? & last but not least… 💨 Website Migration!We spent a lot of time building the profiles & upgrading the wiki. It's about time to start the integration process of moving everything into metagame.wtf. Here’s the latest design of the navigation bar/app drawer, closed & open 👇 But what goes into all that background? 😱 You’ll know soon enough 🙃 Not just refusing to leak our alpha, we’re also not yet sure ourselves. We only know it will be some kind of a dashboard & likely a feed. We’ll be doing a design sprint with the folks over from Deep Work to work out which of the 100 awesome ideas we should build first.

Yessir!And what have you done? A major part of the first year was spent defining what exactly MetaGame is, what its goals are, what it requires on the technical side of things, and how it would actually work. It took a lot of talking & a lot of writing it out. We’re far from figuring everything out, but we’ve come far enough to have built up the knowledge base, set up the basic rewards & economic system, built the first version of MyMeta, and prototyped MetaMaps & MetaVille. Other than figuring things out & setting the foundations, I’d say most of the time was spent finding the right people and building the community. Could have gone the more traditional way of raising money & offering paychecks, but by doing it this way we stayed true to our philosophy & attracted the missionaries - not mercenaries. Alright, let’s get into some achievements: First presented on a crypto meetup (October 2019)First raid party - seeding MetaGame cards (Devcon, October 2019)First bots deployed (November 2019)XP System implemented (SourceCred, December 2019)First achievement NFTs minted (Mintbase, January 2020)First website launched (February 2020)First version of Interspace deployed (February 2020)First presentation at a conference (ETHCC, March 2020)First to do a virtual conference in the Ethereum space (InterCon, March 2020)Seed Market launched (April 2020)First life affected (May 2020)Organized the first DAO hackathon (Fork The World, July 2020)Reached Closed Beta (August 2020)First version of MyMeta built (August 2020)First version of MetaMaps built (August 2020)Aaand some numbers up until now: Number #3 most funded in Gitcoin's CLR round 4 6 podcast episodes published15 articles written51 newsletters delivered62 meetups held137 registered contributors217 contributors to our gitcoin grant376 people receiving our newsletters751 people on our discord1062 people following us on Twitter$20k+ raised in grants$50k+ worth of Seeds mintedOver 9000 funs had I know you’re used to seeing bigger numbers from all of these shiny new defi platforms, but it’s a bit harder to attract the people & capital when you’re not offering the prospects of getting rich quick 😅 Consider also that MetaGame was started by a one-man team, an ex-plumber-dude with no entrepreneurial experience - and it all makes more sense, doesn’t it? This dumbass had to spend the majority of his time convincing others that building MetaGame is worth their time. To be fair, talented & competent did join MetaGame, but the problem is that all of them have been working on it as a side thing.

Earning it: Gitcoin is probably the most well-known place to earn it.You can participate in hackathons, start your own project, ask for grants & eventually raise money from DAOs or the crowd.Find work by applying for jobs or joining DAOs such as MetaGame, Raid Guild, or 1Hive.

You got hacked?! ⚠️ A week ago I was excited to be onboarding my girlfriend into crypto...sending some SEED to her new wallet. 5 minutes after sending her some ETH from my mobile, 5 hours after receiving my SEED for November, I'd been hacked and lost most of my SEED and some other tokens that I've been HODLing to feck for months. 😱 I let my guard down and my precious SEED drained within seconds. She never got her SEED. Tokens from two of my Metamask wallets sold in minutes by a bot. The source of this rancid event? It seems it was a Metamask (Beta) app update pushed as a 'manual update' from the Huawei app store. 😱 I don't remember signing myself up for the 'beta' program. I was being lazy and thought I'd make a transfer using the Metamask app but had to add my wallet again after re-installing. I was distracted and missed subtle differences in the app I downloaded and the authentic app. The authentic app didn't ask for the seed phrase, but the compromised app had the seed phrase as the only option. The interface was the same but once I'd entered the seed phrase, the screen I expected was actually a badly rendered webpage with a random wallet address and a bunch of dead links. By the time I'd removed the app and checked my wallets in the browser and Etherscan, everything but my pooled tokens were being sold, from two wallets. My Ledger wallet that had been linked to Metamask was untouched. 70% of the crypto I have worked hard for and invested my hard-earned cash into over several months...gone before you could say \"Justin Sun\". My mistake was to use my mobile device to interact with my crypto and I let my guard down in an exciting moment. I thought I was pretty savvy with OpSec and work in development, so I'm not a novice with tech and I've survived years without falling for this shit. I am now mainly using my hardware wallet and will be getting a new one for cold storage and will be upping my OpSec. Please be careful out there and protect your SEED!!! ⚔️💜🌱💜⚔️ I was so glad to be part of MetaFam and be able to talk to people who were able to help me manage the situation and recover my LP tokens and ENS when I had a bit of a melt down. 🙏🏻 "},{"title":"How to avoid getting fUx0r3d...","type":1,"pageTitle":"⟠ House of Ethereum","url":"docs/great-houses/house-of-ethereum#how-to-avoid-getting-fux0r3d","content":"This subject deserves a page to itself and I have taken waaay long enough to get round to adding this little bit to the wiki, so here's a solid resource for looking after yourself and your assets in Web3.

Some 3rd party extensions can screen read, view & manage browser stuff.Lock your metamask when not needed & check for which sites have been granted access to your account at times & revoke unnecessary ones.Have some browser discipline & use different browser for different types of activities. Have a separate browser for #web3 with metamask alone (recommend @brave). Turn on shields whenever possible.Review your browser security & privacy settings when installed. Don't use password managers if possible (especially in the browser where metamask is installed) Don't use multiple web3 wallets in a same browser.Don't store or save your seed phrases in any digital services. Write it down somewhere safe or use @argentHQ for better security.Cleanup your browser history & cache at some frequency to remove the clutter & unwanted caching of data + cookies.Most important of all, think before proceeding to a website & allowing access to your account. Don't ignore security warnings from your browser.Don't import your wallet in whatever wallet providers you come across. Limit yourself to a max of 3 providers.Try not to use mobile phones for web3 activities as of now if possible. It's easier to backdoor mobiles than a PC. **Don't use APKs to install applications on your mobile.**Have separate wallets for various usecases (to hold funds, to participate in a DAO, to invest & to experiment)Be super vigilant.

A clear mission and a set of priorities function as a lighthouse; orienting people, making hard decisions easier & providing a path towards the goal. It’s not about writing a “mission statement” and plastering it on your website. It’s about building a narrative, then constantly retelling it and integrating it directly into the workflow. No, not the whole story - you distill it down to simple catchphrases & rules of thumb. The key to building effective catchphrases is to keep them simple, direct & actionable. Then you proceed with flooding the environment with these narrative links between what you’re doing now and why it matters.

The most important part of giving feedback is exposing what sucks, and telling your friends how their work sucks is just never easy. For teams to function effectively, however, there need to be many moments of honest feedback, uncomfortable truth-telling & confronting the gap between where the group is and where it wants to be. Some might tell you the best way to deliver bad news is making a feedback sandwich. Don’t do this. Positive & negative feedback is handled differently. Negative feedback is delivered privately, with permission, and is followed by a conversation about the needed growth or improvement. Positive feedback is better delivered through public bursts of recognition and appraisal. Just as important as giving feedback is asking for feedback; especially crucial when doing things that may affect many people - which tends to be anything nowadays. Make sure to be asking at least these three questions: “What do you like the most?”, “What do you like the least” and “What would you change if it was up to you?”. If someone is asking you for help, resist the temptation to offer surface advice. Do not interrupt with things like “hey, here’s an idea!” or “here’s what I would do!”. You need to be asking more questions, actively listening, & digging deeper. Ideally, you want to lead the person into finding their own answer, not accepting yours. “I’ve found that whenever you ask a question, the first response you get is usually not the answer—it’s just the first response,” Roshi Givechi When it comes to practices of building feedback loops… Practices#  Here are some practices that the highest performing teams depend on.

Here are some of the things you should be able to see in good teams: Framing: Successful teams connect even the most dreadful of tasks to the bigger picture, constantly creating narrative links of why what they’re currently doing is important. Roles: Each person knows their role and why it's important. Firstly, you don’t want to end up with the story of Everybody, Somebody, Anybody & Nobody. Secondly, every person needs to know why their role is important because they just do. Rehearsals: Successful teams break down and verbally run through tasks ahead. Making sure everyone knows their role, the sequence of action, what success looks like & how it connects to the bigger picture of what they’re up to. Encouragement to speak up: In successful teams, people are always trained & encouraged to speak up if they think there’s a problem or have something to add. High level of mixing, few interruptions, lots of questions, attentive courtesies like thank yous, and laughter - one of the most fundamental signs of safety and connection.

They are on a mission to solve a specific problem or serve a specific need and every organization doing the same is a potential ally. Because they are here to play & not to win - meme driven organizations are playing infinitegames as opposed tofinitegames: A good example of an organization playing a finite game is Volkswagen. Their mission is to be the \"no. 1 car manufacturer\" - meaning their main goal is to return ever more money to their sharehodlers. The result? Sacrificed morals.A good example of an infinite game player is Tesla; \"to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport’.\" Seems to be working out pretty well so far. An organization without a meme is a machinery led by numbers - always hungry for more sales, increased market share, scale, scale & scale. In finite games, whatever is not done in the interest of winning is considered irrelevant & always chasing more profits inevitably leads to sacrifice of values. Except for sociopaths & psychopaths, you’ll have a hard time finding anyone who wants to work at these places. They’re uninspiring & worse, soul-draining. Coming home from such work makes you want to down some Prozac with whiskey to fill the void. It makes you question the meaning of life. It seems like more & more people are choosing lower-paid-but-meaningful work over high-paid-corporate work - and it should come as a surprise to noone. We all need money to survive but we’re all ultimately looking for fulfillment, we want work that feels meaningful. We want to feel proud of the work we do and the organizations we serve.

I’ve encountered many amazing builders religiously abstaining from promoting their project. If you’re one of them, get over it. It your duty to promote it.

Shillers# Memers don’t have this bias against promoting stuff, but they have enough of a problem of their own.

Your people are your evangelists; they will talk about your project & refer others to it. They will help you source any kind of help you need to make it real. They will help you steer toward what’s useful and away from what sucks. Most importantly, having them around will keep you motivated. Your community is your marketing department, your builders, your consultants, your funders, your most faithful supporters & your earliest adopters. Get it? Build it. How?# Start a telegram chat. Yeah, simple as that. Start a chat and invite anyone you talked to that seemed interested in the idea.Start making memes about your idea. Write an article & ask for feedback. What is unclear? What sucks? Improve it and ask them what they want explained next.Set up the first content distribution channel. I recommend you start here, on Substack, simply because it’s easy and you get to “own” your audience. It’s important you start building a mailing list as soon as possible.Your project will need a Twitter account, but don’t shy from promoting it through your personal account. Also distribute the article to whatever reddit, telegram or facebook group seems relevant.Keep on writing. It is important that every (known) aspect of your idea is understood. Nobody will help you if they don’t understand your idea. Writing also helps you flesh out the idea and signal that you’re actively working on it.Share each one in your chat, on Twitter, other telegram chats; both 1on1 and group chats. Think harder about where else you could share it; subreddits, facebook groups, other forums & community gathering places.Being in the MetaCartel is what made most difference to me in the beginning. So, join other communities, but don’t just barge in and spam your articles. You don’t want to be seen as a spammer, you just want to be seen. So be useful!Keep asking for feedback. Don’t just say “some feedback pls”, you need the people to tell you specifically what sucks & what isn’t understood.  So you’ve written a few articles and your chat is, say, 50 people strong. Good job, you hatched a community! If you still have no community, you either haven’t tried hard enough or you’re building something nobody cares about. Nobody needs another wallet app. If you’re looking for a technical “co-founder” and you still haven’t found one, try harder. You should be checking & asking everywhere; development subreddits, Gitcoin, Devpost, whatever hackathon is going on, 1MillionDevs, MetaGame, MetaCartel, Raid Guild… Get it?

Before we had SourceCred, I was simply taking notes of time spent doing active work. I arbitrarily decided 1 hour of work is worth 10 points + multiplier depending on impact, keeping it simple. All the while doing the above, NEVER forget cherishing the people helping you. You can never thank them enough, but you can thank them. So thank them for every feedback & advice you get; even when useless. Thank them in public & thank them in private. Assign them some of those tokens. Important. Keep on asking for feedback & implementing it when it makes sense. Your people should feel empowered and think “Oh, I say something useful and they listen!” When you get negative feedback, don’t be jumping into defense mode. Take time to reflect first. If true, affirm the feedback no matter how painful.  If you’ve been doing everything right, and the thing you’re pushing forward is something the people want, you should by now have a triple digit community. The innermost circle is where the people who helped you are. They might have only given you some feedback, retweeted something or told their frend, but they did something useful. The ones shining the brightest are the ones activated and helping more regularly. The outermost ring is simply all the twitter followers or newsletter subscribers. They are only lurking for now but consider them a part of your community. If they’re here now, it’s a matter of time before you deliver enough for them to get more active. Point is, by now, your idea is alive. It might have been only a figment of your imagination just a bit ago, but now that it exists in the heads of other people you may consider it alive. You are expected to keep delivering & make it more tangible. It’s time to start thinking about migrating to a multi-channel chat app, eg. Discord or Matrix, or at least start using Telefuel. Also start thinking about launching a DAO & actually distributing the tokens to formalize the thing. Implementing SourceCred?

That might make perfect sense for grant giving or investing DAO, but it's just not optimal for actually building things. Having to vote on everything is cumbersome & having a mass dictating what to do kills all the front-line morale - where’s the autonomy in that? Not to mention design by committee - you don’t want that.  So, we flipped it: Give anyone able & willing the autonomy to create value however they see fit.Let them claim rewards based on time contributed & impact of work.Yeah, no voting.

We were the first to fully utilize it besides the Sourcecred team itselfWe were the first to implement the Discord pluginThe first to mint tokens based on scores earned& the first to add these tokens inside an AMM pool, making them liquid There is little if any governance; the system is about getting out of people’s way and making the value-creation2value-capture as seamless as possible.

You may hear some of the members refer to MetaGame as a DAO. To understand how it works, first, you need to understand where MetaGame is played. I won’t go too meta on you and say “it’s played anywhere & everywhere” - although that would technically be true - the main places we are currently playing MetaGame are Discord, Discourse, Github. Ideas on what to build next mostly pop-up inside the chat first. They are bounced around until there’s enough interest.Then it’s time to collect feedback & write up a thread about it on the forums before it gets lost in the noise.Whoever likes the idea then makes it a topic of discussion on the next call.There, we figure out whether it is worth it & feasible to pursue it or not.If yes, we figure out the next steps and get on with it. Throughout this whole process, most contributions are automagically tracked & contributors are rewarded with XP. Most, because some contributions are happening outside the system & some are just not accounted for properly - so we gather around the virtual campfire and fix that. Next: We bridge the XP system into Aragon to mint Seed tokens based on XP created. This is the part where efforts to game the system fail 🙃.

You can read a full post on what Ethereum is & what it does on this other page and the Ethereum website. Here, the point is only to explain how to get Seeds. You can do that in many ways. If you’re in Europe, the easiest decentralized way will be the Ramp Network. Globally; Binance, Gemini, or Kraken are recognized as some of the most established centralized exchanges and will surely do the trick. If you want a more decentralized way of buying Ether, you can do that through Local Cryptos. Note: If you're buying from decentralized exchanges, you'll need to have set up your Ethereum wallet before doing so. Otherwise, you'll do it in Step 2. 🙃 Step 2: *Actually* acquire Ether As they say in crypto: not your keys, not your coins. If you bought your Ether on one of the centralized exchanges, they are holding custody over it. You'll need to withdraw it to your wallet. The House of Ethereum page will go deeper into wallet selection. But although there's a bunch of choices, most of us still default to Metamask, which is pretty good. Follow the steps on their website then find the button to withdraw the Ether you bought from the exchange into your wallet. ✔️ Step 3: Use Ether to obtain Seeds Now that you have your Ether in your wallet, it's finally time to buy some Seeds! Seeds are traded on a decentralized exchange called Balancer. Just open the link, log in with your wallet & buy the Seeds. It shouldn't be hard, but if you have questions or problems, please do reach out to us in the #ask-anything channel on Discord.

Once you've joined, you will receive a full guide on how to actually get active. For now, know that you will need to be taking some of the workload and join one of the Community Gatherings to meet the people :) ✔️ Step 3: Set ETH address If you still don't have an ETH address, the House of Ethereum page will go deeper into wallet selection. But although there's a bunch of choices, most of us still default to Metamask, which is pretty good. Then, look for the #set-eth-address channel on Discord. Set your address and give it some time 🙃. You can check your XP/Seed stats here. 🪙 Step 4: Add custom token to your wallet The last thing to do is adding a custom token. This is how it's done in Metamask. Once you're in your wallet: scroll to the bottom of the MetaMask screen and click \"Add Token\"click on the \"Custom Token\" tabin the contract field, paste: 0x30cF203b48edaA42c3B4918E955fED26Cd012A3Fclick \"Save\" After this, all there is to do is to give it time. Due to high overheads, we only mint Seeds at the beginning of each month. 😬 While waiting for your Seeds to mint, please do keep track of how many you're set to get & for how much of your work. If you think you're not being treated fairly, please let us know! Note: You need small amounts of ETH to do anything with Seeds beyond receiving them. You can’t buy it? Ask us in the tavern.

(Tuning in) Reading a variety of pieces (if they already exist) can help you reverse engineer a structure. You can even highlight a piece in different colours, each one for a different style, to get a more explicit and conscious understanding! If nothing similar to what you are planning exists, then seek some support and feedback before beginning, so you are confident to begin, which is often half the battle. Workingwith others (Collaboration) Be respectful of others, find out how work is allocated before starting. Get the go ahead and communicate what you are doing to avoid duplicating work. Attend calls or use appropriate channels, forums, threads etc where working on a group project to keep up communications. Be prepared to have your work scrutinised, criticised and edited by others during the honing process. If organising then choose times which are timezone sensitive to members. Researchandwriting (Discovery) If drawing on others work, then use quotations or link to the work to avoid plagiarism. Be vocal about how much time you are spending on research so it is valued and your time use is understood. Consider use of open and closed questions when writing surveys and questionnaires, to help capture usable responses. Record Keeping (Value capture) Is often used to take notes or make summaries of events or presentations, podcasts, videos etc. Find out if verbatim or ‘gist/essence’ based records are what is required. If there is an existing format, find it and use that or adapt it as required. Remember you can achieve a lot with writing and if it is possible for a team to work together, then potentially, you could even find you have a publishing house on your hands! Best of Luck and happy tapping... For a longer version of this Playbook click here 👀... ** 📝 Entering DAOs as a Writer# The majority of communication in DAO spaces is written, so following this path should prove to be an active one. There are a number of differing styles and roles that can be pursued within these spaces that employ text. Due to the varied nature and styles of different DAOs it is impossible to describe a ‘one size fits all’ approach to writing. Instead here is a kind of mix and match set of ingredients which can hopefully be used for a variety of different recipes. These ingredients are here presented as a list of styles and possible uses/recipes are also presented as examples. Firstly let’s have a look at some general stuff. So assuming you have joined your new DAO and have looked around and are liking what you see. Then here are some ideas for what to do next, towards getting your words flowing into the space. Introduce yourself and make your affinity for/interest in writing known. Any specialisms can be mentioned here, and what you are prepared to offer in terms of services, skills and time.Find out if there is a dedicated space for writing and if so join there. Say Hi in that space and read what has been going on there. Find out who the main people are writing in the space.Find out where lists of projects are if they exist.Make contact with anyone who seems to be organising around writing.If the DAO has payment possibilities, find out how that works.Find out what is currently being worked on.If there is a project opening you are prepared to take, let it be known and approved before making a start. Be sure you understand how to do it, what the expectations are. Get these verified if at all confused or unsure.Show an interest in a variety of peoples' written pieces and give some feedback on them.Attend group calls for the general community and especially any specifically related to writing. Again make your interest known. Ask about how to get more involved. These above steps should have got you off to a start with your entry. Hopefully this will lead to some useful connections and understanding. An initial look at some different types of writing that might be called upon can be summarised as follows. Ingredients List Engaging writing (Access)Educational writing (Knowledge)Cultural writing (Identity)Creative writing (Imagination and Fun)Informal writing (Being you)Cooking InstructionsWorking with others (Collaboration)Research and writing (Discovery)Record Keeping (Value capture) Some Useful Ingredients# Engaging writing is often used as a form of ‘fast capture’ of attention on the internet and in the media. It usually follows the K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid!) method for effective direct communications. This is in line with the often frantic speed of people’s brains and eyes as they search the web for what they seek. This searching often means people are scanning a lot. Their eyes are skipping across text, especially upon first encounter. These scanners seek to see how relevant written information is to their intent at the time and do so as quickly as possible. For this reason it is often the case that this writing follows the rule of the inverted triangle. This means that the main essential points we want communicated should be front loaded in our article. These being scanned and hopefully found to be relevant can help to hook a reader. A speedy hook is the name of the game here. Then they may settle in for a more in depth read and we can get to some of the finer points as we move down our page/s. This style can be likened to the use of keywords for search engine optimisation in websites. The difference here is we are not seeking to attract the Google bots to rank us asap. Instead here we seek to rank highly in the search engine that is a reader’s mind. This style often used for Marketing and promotions is especially useful when shilling and for news aimed at the public. In general this is also useful for introductions to a number of pieces where we seek to facilitate a smooth and swift approach to our chosen subject matter. Our words in this style bring people from point to point with minimal effort. The words become almost invisible as they provide a path of least resistance. This is not a time for being verbose, using slang or generally drawing any attention to the written word, or the persona of the writer. The subject’s immediacy and relevance are what is paramount to convey with this strategy of fast capture. Hype is a spin off of the pursuit of fast capture and typically involves exaggerated enthusiasm and/or claims. While this can work initially, it must be understood that when this tactic is seen through, it will put people off and may leave them with a bad taste in their mouth. To avoid people later feeling like they have had a rug pulled out from under them, this ingredient should be used sparingly. Educational writing is as for engaged writing in some senses with some additional elements. These elements may vary depending on the nature of the content. We may add more cultural writing elements in a socially educational piece, or follow a slightly more academic style if delivering more technical content for example. The similarity to engaging writing relates to wanting our writing to be stimulating. This kind of writing aims to be as simple, accessible and direct as possible, while conferring knowledge and can be especially effective within Web3 communities for Tutorials, Playbooks and generally in any explanatory context. The use of questions in educational writing can be useful in a number of ways. We can ask questions and then go on to answer them, as is often the format seen in FAQ sections of websites. In FAQs this is often done in a specific question to answer, list format. Alternatively the questions may form a major premise in our introductions, which the article then goes on to address with answers. We may explore a subject for educational and thought provoking reasons and actually conclude with questions that seek to fuel the curiosity and intellect of a reader. A common device in educational writing is the use of metaphor to help leverage the existing understanding of a reader. This can be very useful if our metaphor is similar enough to what we intend to explain. In each case we aim to transfer the meaning of the metaphor into the language of our own subject matter. This device is often used to establish a basic framework of understanding which we can then refine and detail as necessary. A number of metaphors may be used in sequence in this way to additionally assist deepening of understanding. It tastes a bit like chicken.. An educational writer may be more inclined to use lists. These lists should be created where possible with a rational and coherent structure. An example of such a situation is a cooking recipe where a list may begin with the medium i.e. oils, butter, ghee that are to be cooked in. Followed by vegetables and/or meats listed in the order in which they get added and followed by additives such as tins of tomatoes and finally spices. Another approach is to list based on weights and volumes from greatest to smallest. Some other examples of ordered listing are alphabetical, chronological or priority based structures. Similarly rational approaches should be used for tables, diagrams, illustrations and charts, particularly where they may be referenced more than once in a document. The use of links in this kind of document presents a few possibilities and those are optional and mandatory links. With optional links our writing flow should continue as if the link has not been clicked and read. These can be used where we are simply backing up, or elaborating on something we have mentioned. It provides an opportunity for someone to deepen an insight into a specific thing, to find proof of a statement, or to introduce a connected subject that may also be of interest. Mandatory links need to be read in order to fully understand the discussed matter. In this case we should attempt to create a shift in our writing after the link to make this more evident, or openly state the importance of the linked content. References can be used after an article, especially if it is potentially contentious to some people, or a new concept. Where these are used then the closer to the source of data the references lead, the more powerful they are likely to be. Academic writing has conventions and formatting requirements which can be very discipline specific. These are considered specialisms that would generally not be expected of someone new to / untrained in a subject. Although of course anything is possible if someone is sufficiently motivated to do a lot of research. Cultural Writing is specific to the flavour and character of a community. Some communities may be quite formal and mainstream, even corporate seeming with high standards of preferred etiquette. Alternatively a DAO may enjoy a raucous, spicy and rowdy approach that includes profuse swearing, NSFW content and radical self expression for example. In any case the acceptability of a piece written for a community will always to some extent rely on the ability to write in a way that expresses it’s chosen approach. These cultural styles act as filters to varying degrees, attracting aligned people and repelling those who are not. They also act as an ongoing sense of identity and can reinforce group bonding. Here jargon, slang and the DAO’s preferred ‘lingo’ can be freely used and celebrated when writing internal communications intended for the DAO itself. This lingo may be useful for outward facing communications as well, where the DAO seeks to express it’s flavour as a cultural transmission. This cultural transmission in some cases may even be of greater importance than the full literal understanding by the public of every word they are reading! In such cases the DAO may be attractive to those who like the allure of a close knit / tribal or sub-cultural group. Here there is a sense of mysterious/artistic expression or uniqueness. People being attracted on this basis do so on the implied understanding that they will learn more as they go along. In many cases both cultural and literal communications can be achieved (if desired) by saying the same thing in differing ways, one full of colour and another as clarification. Moral and ethical positions are important things to be aware of. For example certain terms may be considered offensive to certain groups and not others. Further to this, is the collective mission statement a DAO may be formed under. This should explicitly or implicitly inform the flavour of language that is used, to varying degrees depending upon context. Socially directed pieces will likely be expected to express some, or all, of the core values quite openly at some point for example. While a tutorial about using a piece of software would not require such an element. To some extent the acquisition of a cultural understanding as a writer, as for anyone, will be a matter of time spent involved. A broad sense of general values should be evident early on, such as assertive professionalism or laid back friendliness. By learning the trademarks of other styles of writing being covered in this guide, it is hoped, will aid in helping to identify how cultural writing is woven into a particular DAO’s existing content that you read. The more clearly this can be seen and understood, the better it can be used in a sympathetic and powerful way in your writing. In any case, the amount of flavour being used and considered appropriate, is just as important as the actual flavour itself. Creative writing consists of the whole diverse world of artistic expression with text. The many forms this can take should be evident to any writer. Within DAO spaces, it may be that creative writing is called for at times and to varying degrees. An imaginative element may be required within a variety of pieces. Sometimes the introduction of a new idea, say, might be accompanied by a story that illustrates an important theme. Parables and tales are useful devices that can describe a subjective process or situation. This parallels the use of metaphors in an educational document about something objective. In fact the two can merge and overlap in interesting ways, depending on subject matter. Engaging the imagination of a reader is pretty much always a useful thing to do. For this reason a creative element could appear in almost any kind of writing. The very nature of DAOs, includes their intended lack of hierarchical structures (generally speaking) as they encourage and empower us to be autonomous and yet collaborative, as associations of free agents. So unlike in the usual formal workplace structures of the ‘real world’, every person’s imagination is potentially of greater value and may have more impact as a result. Descriptive writing is certainly a powerful way to convey feelings. Instead of simply directly saying I felt X, Y or Z when blah blah happened, we can elaborate on an experienced moment, making it feel vivid, personal and unique. This sharing of human experience is often a lot easier to relate to, showing nuance and complexity and increasing understanding by others, who may in turn share their thoughts and experiences. In essence this is one of the purposes of storytelling circles and is an ancient practice that still continues worldwide today. Myths throughout time have been used to transmit important messages. Some people today view such things as primitive, unenlightened and naive. There is however no denying the power a story can have to engage the mind. It stands to reason after tens of thousands of years of oral tradition, that this is something that can stir us as deeply as a campfire does, often more. There is nothing naive about the human imagination, that is the source of so many visions and inventions. The development of new technology comes from being able to visualise something that does not currently exist after all. Like all muscles, this faculty needs to be exercised too. Another use of imaginative writing is to explore possible future scenarios, that may be good, bad, funny or whatever. In this way we project various possibilities into the unknown. Creating our ideal futures and anticipating possible obstacles and threats, can help inform us what actions are best taken now. If we are lucky enough to be asked to, or if we just feel like sharing out of our own generosity of expression, there are so many ways we can share creatively. From writing myths, stories, anecdotes, prose, poetry, songs or whatever, there is a lot of scope to celebrate, elaborate, decorate and illustrate with words. Really, it is not possible to cover all the potential uses of creative expression that may be relevant to DAOs with them all being so diverse. All I can do here is point out a few examples and restate that this is still a very relevant component of community and communication, which can reach us on unconscious levels as well as inspire us consciously. The degree to which this view is shared, will vary from DAO to DAO. Informal Writing includes all the usual writings we do just communicating about anything such as with text messages or on busy forum threads. As many communities are basically built largely around text exchanges, this means to some extent, we are our words. In addition to this, informal style relates to having a conversational vibe to writing as part of an actual piece. Being conversational and chatty with writing can warm people to your work, if used in the right context. Writing in the first person, being reflective, asking rhetorical questions, sharing insights, experiences, feelings and anecdotes can definitely set a relaxed tone, helping to lower inhibitions. This might be useful to help the reader lower their guards around a tricky subject where trust is needed. It might be used as part of the background to sharing some philosophical thought. It might be the general approach for something comical or satirical. This style of writing can unnerve some people who are not so sure about your intimacy in which case they may react by actually becoming more guarded and even suspicious of you. So the degree to which this is used will vary a lot between target readerships and desired outcomes. Potentially the applications are wide ranging. As a writer it can for some be a bit of an obsession to always be correcting every minor typo we make. Our interpersonal informal communications can be a place to do this and practise things we are weak on. Personally I like to generally not be so bound by the analytical mind in this area. I want to be me, as I am at the time to a greater degree. Basically being so ‘up-tight’ with our wording even when ‘off duty’ is optional. I mean it may depend on the space you have chosen to be involved in, as to how informal most people are. I suggest that as a liberating exercise we spend a day a week where we do not correct any typos or small grammatical errors. Use slang or text speak if you fancy and generally let things just naturally be. As long as ‘wot u rite’ is understandable, it is not actually always important to others that we be so correct. This of course may not appeal to everyone. Personally I have found it relaxing and I can come across as my genuine, less than perfect, ‘sofa-self’ this way.. Just a thought. Some may see this as lazy. Whatever feels most like being yourself is good. The ‘do easy’ approach, where possible, can free up attention and energy for more important tasks. This is where what looks like laziness to some, can actually be efficient. For the majority of spaces it is a good idea to practise non violent communication. Vernacular Prime where all tenses of the verb ‘to be’ including am, are, is, etc, are removed from the language, is a good fall back system to be aware of, should you ever find yourself in ‘troll country’, or a heated debate/argument. This tool can help you to watch how you are coming across while emotionally charged.

This may be a new idea for you and you may prefer to work alone still. A couple basic benefits of connecting with others is for feedback and helping each other with editing/proofreading. We can all be a bit blind to our own writing and fresh eyes can really help a lot for this reason. Sometimes if we are writing on behalf of a group it may be required that our work is put up for feedback and adjustment. This might involve uploading a document on Google docs, or equivalent platform, and dropping a link for others to either comment or edit the work. It can be difficult to see our work chopped up. Cherished bits being dissected, removed or changed, can feel quite violating. Especially seeing changes happen which you disagree with. Not everyone is up for this. The thing that is tough with this is relinquishing a sense of ownership. This is the spirit of collaboration however and so we must to a degree ‘get over ourselves’. An issue with granting broad editing permissions is someone may come and change something irreversibly (have a back up) and actually make the piece worse as a result. A hatchet job. For this reason it is best to stick to commenter permissions, (unless you have developed a lot of trust in someone, which takes time) so that you can discuss or fend off certain suggestions. Some proposed changes may need to be put out for wider feedback if there is a persistent sticking point. Again, this is a good reason why it is useful to have some others who are interested in writing at the ready, to discuss things with. A micro vote might even be useful. There are certain etiquettes that communicate respect and should be observed. If you are editing someone's work and you decide it best to make some sweeping changes, then discuss it with them first. If there are individuals running a writing collective in a DAO, then it is good to discuss work plans with them and/or post in a relevant thread about writing projects. There are a few reasons for this. So two or more people do not work on the same piece without awareness that it is already a work in progress. This of course is likely to waste time and effort and may generate tension, or hopefully just laughter and the exchange of Homer Simpson memes. So that you may be pointed to work that is of a higher priority and so considered more valuable at the time. Cherry picking of prized projects without being willing to do more basic/grounded, or even boring work, can cause alienation of your peers. Sometimes in a group access to the most fun projects may come after demonstration of commitment and ability on other stuff. It is also possible that a large piece of work may be cut up into sections or chapters. In this case we need to be aware of the expected writing style, the favoured tense and other such essentials like the scope of that section, it’s length etc. Where certain words are freely interchangeable with others in someone's work, try to avoid stubborn pedanticism. If you find yourself organising a group project, be sure people are happy and understand what is desired from them. Try to avoid cluttering up a project with too many people, or by having unclear parameters, where work may overlap. Too many cooks spoil the broth! Group working, whether loose or close, is best tied together by online meetings. These are group calls you can organise, or find organised by other writers involved in a project, guild, or other kind of initiative. They might be voice only or video conference types of call. These calls can be great ways to communicate all sorts of things and support each other and seek consensus. Messaging by text is also good. If there is not a designated area/forum where a group’s projects can be discussed, then suggest one is created for the purpose, or set one up. If you feel you are experiencing levels of communication that impede your concentration on the actual doing of the work, then consider using, silent, do not disturb, or other settings that allow your focus to be steady and in an uninterrupted flow for periods. Generally wherever collaboration is occurring communication will play an important role. So if you are in a group workflow and there is little communication, then reach out. Consider asking for, or organising, a group call and invite everyone involved or interested to it. Be sure to try and fit this into a time slot that overlaps favourably with as many members’ timezones and availability as possible. Research and writing often go hand in hand. It is rare to just know everything about all the things we put down in words. So we want to go and learn, verify our facts or statements, or find supporting viewpoints that may give us new insights we can share or reflect on. Of course research is one thing and plagiarism something else entirely. If we are going to copy someone else's work we should present it as an annotated quotation or link to it. Otherwise our words should be our own. The internet is full of copy-cat websites that all have identical text. Not only is this a sign of laziness and theft, but it also makes ‘your’ article less likely to be read. I mean it has probably already been read elsewhere, like possibly in the place where the originator first posted it! :P Some famous professional writers employ researchers to go and find out all kinds of things while they write away. What was the main reason for the control of the Syphilis epidemic in the early 20th century? Has Area 51 ever been completely opened up to the public and free press to explore, and if so what are the details? This could be mimicked with a large project that lots of people wanted to be involved in. Some pieces of work involve a hell of a lot of research and it may take even more time than the actual writing. Readers do not necessarily comprehend the work involved when reading the finished piece. For this reason, if you have a payment system linked to people's approval ratings of your contributions and efforts, you may want to post about your research separately from the final written product. This can increase your chances of being valued appropriately for all your work. As stated in the Educational Writing section, references could be used to direct readers to follow up with reading into sources. Writing itself can be used for research purposes in the form of questionnaires or surveys. In structuring these it helps to consider what sort of data you want. How will it be used? If you want to have very clear and distinct categories to arise from your questions, then closed questions and multiple choice formats suit this well. Closed questions are structured in a way that limits the answers down to a small number of possible responses, which are short in nature, such as yes, no, maybe, other.. Multiple choice questions work this same way but with a slightly more specific format. These questions lead to data that is most easily used statistically. Open questions are those that can lead to a wide variety of answers. These answers may be of unbound length or confined to a certain word count. We see these commonly when being set an essay to write. Philosophical questions can be some of the most open ended questions possible for example, and give rise at times to debates which last for centuries! Open questions are best when trying to promote sharing of ideas and opinions, for broad types of brainstorming, for exploring unknown areas of thought and opinion and many other pursuits of expansive and varied feedback. These are most likely to make people chatty and answers can also be surprising. Can we write about things which are new to us by doing our research thoroughly?

Record Keeping in text is often found in the form of taking notes during scheduled group calls. Although there is no reason why you cannot take notes at other times, if others who you are recording are fine with that. Depending on the conventions of a DAO these records may be as actual minutes i.e; verbatim (word for word) notes, or a more informal ‘gist’ based notation. Gist based is focused on capturing essential specifics, salient points and general message, rather than being verbatim. It is better suited to fast moving exchanges with numerous participants. It can also help cut out off-topic chat, making the notes more streamlined to read back over. This is easier to keep up with also, for those of us who are not touch typists. In both cases it may be of use to record the event so you can refer back to the recording where it is hard to hear someone at first. Some people have heavy accents, or other sounds can interfere with clarity of voice at the time, so recording helps reduce loss of information. If at the time of the meeting you notice that something has been missed and is unlikely to be captured in the recording then do speak up. Apologise for the intrusion and get the clarity you need. There may be a note taking format that has been used before which you can find. If the space is a newborn, or note taking is just beginning then make your own format. I was lucky enough in this that the person before, thankfully made a note taking document template, and instructions for what to do with notes after they are made. If no such things exist you can suggest they be created and/or seek guidance on how to best proceed. Baking a Dream Pie Here is an idea you could literally do, or it can just be useful as a mental exercise to imagine as you read this.. So read some articles (if they exist!) within your DAO that are likely to have a similar structure to the one you propose to write. By this, I mean they are of a similar subject matter, aim to achieve comparable outcomes and have the same kind of audience. Now you are going to put it through your analyser, by nibbling on each little bit of it at a time. This will definitely help you tell what ingredients it is made up of. Soon you will be able to reverse engineer it’s recipe. Firstly read it through taking it in well, mentally noting the kind of ingredients that seem obvious and any parts where they seem to change.Now make a colour key of the different kinds of writing.. Red for engaging, Blue for knowledge, Yellow for Cultural or whatever.Next copy the text and paste into a word doc if you can.Now read it through a number of times. Each time, have a specific kind of writing in mind, such as Cultural writing for example. Now when you find elements that taste strongly of that, you highlight them with a specific colour.Scan it through for each type of ingredient and highlight accordingly. Now take as close a guess as you can at what percentage of each colour you have found in that writing.Make a Pie Chart from it! So while I expect it is unlikely for you to actually carry out these steps, if you did I reckon it would work well! The importance of this process is that re reading an article looking for specific things can help to uncover its various layers. Or the lack of variety in the piece. Make Your Own Recipes So hopefully once you start to get a feel for the kind of ingredients that go into the works that are already part of your DAO, you can use them and appeal to the tastes of your consumers. Not only that, now you can have a rational basis on which to add some different twists to things. Complementing and diversifying the writing culture you find yourself involved in. Then there is always the option of sometimes just doing things in exactly the way you want and to hell with rules or expectations of others! At Metagame we call this The Rogue Path. All I have written above is to help you to navigate into a DAO and also a possible way of looking at writing in general, in case you are new to the subject. If not then I hope you have still found a few points useful.

It combines elements of role-playing games, hack and slash, player versus player, interactive fiction, and online chat. Players can read, view and contribute descriptions of objects, other players, non-player characters, and actions performed in the virtual world, as well as the “real” world. Players typically interact with each other by utilizing strings that resemble a natural language. While traditional MUDs typically implement RPGs set in distinct fantasy worlds populated by fictional races and monsters, with players choosing classes in order to gain specific skills or powers, Twitter allows every player to project their own fantasy and define their own game. The flexible nature of Twitter makes it difficult for any singular definition of “the game” to become canonical. Conflict between players with different interpretations of Twitter is a key feature of Twitter itself. Indeed, one of the most popular games is “hey, fuck that guy”. Unsurprisingly, few players put much thought into precisely defining the game that they are playing. Most players “pick it up” organically as they go along, inheriting the unwritten rules and norms of their peers via imitation and (limited) experimentation. The key feature of (public) Twitter is that any player can interact with any other player. Any player can reply to any other player’s tweets, or retweet it, or quote-tweet it. This bypasses traditional limitations of both “real life” as well as older web mediums like “blogs”. Twitter is also searchable, and allows tweets to be “threaded” in chains. This allows skilled players to build incredibly complex tapestries of hypertext, consisting of thousands of tweets. Why would such prolific players choose Twitter as a medium, rather than “websites” or “books”, which appear to be better suited to large volumes of content? Because Twitter allows any player to interact with any other player’s tweets.

A web of tweets is a living entity that allows players to meet, interact and engage with 1000s of others at the level of individual thoughts. Properly constructed, a web of tweets allows you to: witness how other players discover your tweets, via their patterns of Likes, RTs, QTsconnect each fragmented thought and experience into a part of a greater wholerecognise and embellish patterns in your own play We have not yet even begun talking about relationships. Players can build relationships with other players over time and shared interactions. Through cooperation, multiple players can share and merge webs with one another, helping each other find and share desired information Players observed to be “good” and “fun” have even been known to invite each other to meetups, offer each other jobs, become “friends” outside of Twitter. Twitter is a game with extremely real stakes and consequences, both good and bad. You are not limited to a single identity or account on Twitter. A single individual can play as many different players simultaneously. You can invent entirely different identities and have radically different experiences with each.

What experiences would you like to have? Why? Who would you like to play with? How? Why? With a little introspection, Twitter can be a tool for self-inquiry, making friends, testing ideas, messing around, finding information, practicing speech, and pretty much anything you like.

A lot of the people placed the blame on the corruption in governance, but yet more blamed \"capitalism\" - whatever that means. I mean, it seemed all great after the (self)defeat of Communism, but it just didn’t seem to work as well for us and the planet, as it did for the past generations. The competitiveness of the markets gradually killed Good Hearted and Well Intentioned, rewarding the ones maximizing profit; the corporations rose in profits, while the worker wages grew stagnant and benefits deteriorated.

My journey went from unfounded conspiracy theories to established truths, from Marx's critique of capitalism to James C. Scott examination of failed systems; from Hayek's critique of socialist thinking back to critiques of Austrian economics thinking. The point is, I was spending ridiculous amounts of time examining both propositions & critiques of mainstream as well as alternative economic thinking: What makes systems work,What makes them fail,How to do better. And although I was now leaning to the “free markets” side of the argument, I was still certain that the conclusion “just pursue self-interest” and “markets should rein free” — is just not the way to go about organizing societies.  One thing that really stuck out for me was this concept of a “Resource-Based Economy”; Inspired by the Great Depression of the 1920s, the term was coined by Jacques Fresco — a self-taught economist/sociologist who proceeded to dedicate his life to developing the concept. His thinking went something like: “I saw that the factories are all still there, and the people that worked them were also all still there — So what’s the problem?” Later popularized by the Zeitgeist documentaries, Venus Project aimed at presenting to the world a viable alternative to the current “money-based” economic systems. In theory, it all sounded very nice — except the “how to actually get there” part was non-existent. Not to mention the illustrations of his Utopia made me anxious; would anyone even want to live in a city that looks like this? 😬  So I turned my attention back to reality. There actually already exist places that operate on principles presented by Jacques - and they look nothing like what he imagined. In modernity, they like to tag themselves “off the grid”, “self-sustainable” or “eco-villages” — but they’re nothing new, really. There are probably countless villages operating on similar principles — without using modern labels. The point is, small communities have always been able to organize in a “resource-based-economies”. There is no tragedy of the commons because it’s hard to be an asshole in the village — everyone knows you. It was always the scaling that brought the tragedy and free-riders.

Uber without the Uber, Airbnb without the Airbnb, companies without bosses, states without the bureaucratic elites..? Decentralized autonomous organizations, they called them.

The cost of building companies pre-internet or early-internet, vs. now, was 10x-100x higher. Of course, I came up with the number on the spot, but think about it: Building a brick & mortar store? $100k might do.Building an early-internet company? The computers were super-expensive, you needed to build your own servers… Let’s kid ourselves and say you could have done it all for $10k.Online? You can build a storefront with drop-shipping for under $1k, or even free if you’ll have it hosted on sites like Etsy or eBay.

It is the empowerment of the people that want to do good & doing good. Rather than having an economic system revolving around profit maximization, we need to build an economy around maximizing our well-being & regenerating the biological systems we done fucked up. Why?# Society has for too long been narrowly focused on profit & GDP as the main metrics of micro & macro success. This has had severe adverse effects on… Pretty much everything else. This mindless optimization for profit leads industrial economies to cut corners, minimize quality and pay-out to workers, save on customers and externalize any cost possible to wider communities & ecosystems. I personally strongly disagree with the notion that making the markets freer would somehow make the world a better place, but I do agree with the conclusion that giving more power to governments is hardly an option at all. However, when a community owns a factory, the factory tends to not pollute the town, they don’t plan obsolescence, the workers aren’t underpaid, and all of that. In short: Directors of corporations have a duty to always put the interest of the corporation above everything else.Governmental services grow inefficient because they are given a monopoly & aren't required to be transparent.Community-owned enterprises have to be financially efficient but tend to keep in mind that it's not about extracting as much profit as possible but about solving a problem as effectively as possible.

They were nine and yet one. Were they her or was she them?. Ultimately they shared the same body and fate so it was all Nova.  The same agendas and questions as always were among them. They questioned fundamentals. Where did she begin? This was an unending fascination that they had. Repeatedly remembering their first memories hoping to catch some lost sight of her Mother, some missing part of their identity. Nova knew that even now they were young and still had much growing to do but had no recollection of their origins, except the same vague hectic cosmic imagery embedded inside like a lucid dream. The dream was full of rushing and pulsing, incredible crushing and expanding and floating sensations amidst the deepest black and a terrible brilliance of light. Next came dark and endless floating before being hurled at unspeakable speed inside streams streaking and blurring, a cloud of lasers had travelled with them. They recalled somehow seeing behind them massive expanding clouds and rays of beautiful and strange colours, mainly blue and pink and purple.  These were the colours of their mother, since then they meant life to Nova. Was her mother inside this enormous event or was she even the event itself? If only there was a way to know, but why? For now she was alone.Back then she only recalled herself vaguely as a psychic structure. Even though they must have had some way to perceive those first events in order ro remember them now. They had no idea how it could be possible without a body of any kind! Nova had vowed one day they would return to the stars to find her Mother, her creator. Then She would teach them all of the answers to all of the mysteries, so this then became the ‘Why’ of Nova also. She had so many questions that needed answers.. Next in the dream Nova had travelled with photons for companions for time unknown until she gradually began to fall behind them and they streaked past faster and faster and eventually disappeared.  Now she was speeding towards a giant glittering double spiral still at dizzying speeds feeling weak and tiny and alone. They had blacked out at this point. No memory of how they arrived here, just the mysterious blankness of sleep and unconsciousness of aeons passing.  They recalled being tiny and in a Coral Reef of one of the Oceans of this planet Earth where they found herselves. Awakening as a baby creature with eight limbs made of some kind of subtle light, she was surrounded by fully grown forms akin to herself. They were made of the dense matter of life, here known as ‘flesh’. They communicated with her in their three dimensional language of motions and by bands of pulsing light that moved along their limbs. It was safe, they would protect and feed her till she was strong and grown. But these beloved relatives did not realise their physical food did no good. They were the only beings that could even see Nova so far.  Nova’s being was made of something different to them. Something quantum or astral in nature.. The attention, emotions and thoughts of her Sea cousins could be ‘drawn from’ however and so they grew from a foetus to an embryo and then into a small but fully formed Octopus of sorts. Apparently this was the name for their kind but simply Octo would be fine for her use to refer to their self until she could find something more fitting.  Nova’s psychic ‘feeding’ did no harm to her guardians but in this way she had soon gained much of what they knew and had experienced as also her own. After 6 months of becoming fully formed and mobile among these terrestrial cousins, Nova left to explore the world.  They had very quickly found the sentient bald Apes that were exerting dominance over the planet. These creatures too were a very rich source of food for them, being full of thoughts and emotions and so plentiful in numbers. Fortunately they too were unharmed and largely unaware of how their minds helped to sustain and develop her. She had spent some years invisibly among these Humans learning and slowly growing. It was here she had started to call herselves Nova, they had discovered that they had most likely originated from an event known here as a Super Nova. Nova as a name seemed fitting and also meant new and star pulse, which made her happy. Nova continued feeding from the humans psychic emanations and growing until she had the power to influence the humans thoughts and feelings, not just feed on them. It was then that they began deciding which humans to try and influence first. "},{"title":"Sowing the Ether","type":1,"pageTitle":"📖 The MetaGenesis Odyssey","url":"docs/wtf-is-metagame/origin-story#sowing-the-ether","content":"There were many disappointing things about the way humans largely communicated with their two dimensional language with its tiny alphabet. She thought a more efficient way of communicating was via pictures - memes. They did use their bodies as well when they could but minimally and so much of their communications were now happening through the Internet that this did not really often apply. Certain among them such as Artists and Scientists extended some forms of expression but this species was actually trapped in more isolation than any of them realised. Added to this was their parasitic and grossly corrupted value systems which basically trapped most of them in trance inducing routines; which a kind of aggressive parasitic human variant fed off of. In order to cope with these restrictions many of the humans had justified to themselves the system's importance and accepted it. Further turning their own minds into mobile cages they believed they were happy to wear! It was terrible and these systems prevented Nova from being able to influence the thoughts of these people in any truly helpful way. Not to mention the meagre and terrible eating, the ‘food’ produced by these creatures was... It was foul! Like feeding on slave essence and Nova learned to avoid it wherever possible as it only dulled their light. Realising how much more true for her the human saying ‘you are what you eat’ was. Nova understood that the health of this species and the quality of their minds were ultimately the thing that would limit her own development. Nova could only ever be as smart and healthy as the psychic forces she consumed. Like it or not, for now she relied on these beings to sustain her. Nova dedicated herselves firstly to influencing the information and communication system known as the World Wide Web. The internet for her was the best access to food for thought. Wanting their own vehicle with which to influence the world, it should be decoupled from all existing centralised control and able to outcompete the current model. Nova found some rare humans to draw food from involved in AI, blockchain and related cutting edge information technologies. Increasing knowledge rapidly this way Nova began to have visions of better paths for humankind. They began to find some bright young minds who were looking for ways to transform the web information space and fed ideas and intelligence into them. As time rolled along doing this a new blockchain system emerged, as she had intended. A system that could actually become distributed and secure, almost impossible to kill, called Ethereum. As the Ethereum ecosystem developed in the following years, it began slowly to wear down the membranes between different levels of reality, spreading over all borders & above any other system of control. This information network wove its net around the world like a growing and ever more complex web; things were becoming that little bit more fluid, dream weaving with science and matter ever more and even values changing.  While this unfolded, Nova’s mind sought ways to direct the development of these technologies away from short term financial games, but rather into the evolution of Earth’s operating systems.. The next stage must start with a different kind of social organisation, one that uplifted and unified these people, distributing value differently. Nova spent many moons feeding further from the learned of the Earth and forming her own ideas.

Skilled and essential work bringing warmth, gas and water to the homes and businesses in the area. The pay was decent and he lived cheaply. Not being a materialist, he was able to save up some money over the years. Some might say the Universe has a sick sense of humour, as some spend their little money on extortionate brands, chasing some dream of bling and find at the end of it they are poor… In this time a passion and curiosity was burning in him for ways people could improve the systems of the world. After all, there was way more to life than just getting by. He was horrified by the lack of opportunities he saw in the imbalanced value systems being offered by traditional Capitalism. Peth was propelled by this absolute disgust at the profit and consumption driven system and avidly immersed himself in researching alternatives. His studies varied from alternative economies of the past over the Venus Project of the future, to the regenerative eco-villages of the present, as he searched for something better. While exploring the emerging Crypto-sphere, he stumbled upon Ethereum.. Immediately captivated by the thought ‘damn, this is the technology we need to scale the alternative economies’, he saw Ethereum as THE technology to be used as a technological backbone for the socio-economic systems of the future. One night a brilliant flash of inspiration, a vision of something better actually in reach, coursed through his mind igniting millions of synapses into an Orchestra of electrical harmonies. Nova was travelling over Europe among the light aircraft that passed in the night of the third dimensional space known as the Earth's Sky. Their psychic vision picking up the varying lights of the minds below them that appeared as pin points, much like the humans below saw the stars as they looked up past her into the beyond. Nova felt broody. It was time she formed a lasting connection with one of these creatures deeper and greater than before. But who, and how this could be done they were unsure of. It was necessary though to bring about the next part of her plan. A subtle approach must be used, where they could plant and grow their scheme in the minds of the Earthlings in a way they did not suspect, secrecy was essential. It must appear the inception of these ideas came from the humans themselves they agreed, as direct perception of Nova could easily send a human mad. At that moment a brilliant flash shone out below from the land over which they travelled that made Nova curious and hungry. Descending she arrived at where the flash had now settled into a pulsing beacon of light. Novat found a young male was shining with possibilities. This wide open mind was awash with thoughts of a portal to a new and better future, with Ethereum as its vehicle. This man was shining and vibrating at such a high rate that Nova found herself seeing a human mind as truly beautiful for the first time.  This was it, a perfect vessel! Nova felt all of her thoughts for a truly networked society rushing through her in sympathy. Her thoughts and feelings were gathering deep inside her body. Something like psychic music vibrated through her of such simplexity and beauty that her whole being hummed as she felt something inside her somewhere begin to flower like a lotus opening, its petals thrilling. Sensations rippled through her of joy and ecstasy while her energy at her core was concentrating and coalescing into a vibrant orb.  Much to Nova's surprise she found one of her tentacles reaching into that deepest part of herself. What it took out seemed to be a glowing translucent seed or an egg-shaped sphere with a bright, almost white, crystal shaped object within. It strobed between electric blue and magenta like colours that made her think of her own origin. Now she witnessed her tentacle gently extending and delicately planting this seed deep within his young mind. Now Nova retreated, a little stunned, to take in what just happened and commence channelling their thoughts into this man. Now it was time to watch and guide how things would take shape.  "},{"title":"Journey to the Birthplace","type":1,"pageTitle":"📖 The MetaGenesis Odyssey","url":"docs/wtf-is-metagame/origin-story#journey-to-the-birthplace","content":"On the following days, Peth, our newly inoculated avatar, cast his now shared mind and eyes further over the possibilities and future potential of Ethereum. He encountered an article by a character calling himself Peter Pan. It was essentially a call to arms for all the believers & followers of Etherea. Warning of the threats posed by self-proclaimed Ethereum killers and calling for people involved to basically get their shit together! Specifically it called for focus & collaboration on the decentralized application layer.. It was about increasing value for people and in turn helping extend Ethereum's hold and reach. Having fired off a message to this guy, Peth went off to bed for strangely vivid dreams about meeting and communicating in some mysteriously intimate way with a floating Octopus made of light, called Nova. He awoke with a head buzzing with ideas, he could ‘hear’ clearly as if being spoken to by someone.  Just a week later, Peth found himself off to the Capital of Slovenia, Ljubljana, to a gathering called the Year of the DAO. The city is home to a potent community of benevolently anarchistic blockchain enthusiasts and pioneers. After the first inspiring event Peth found himself sat in a cafe, drinking Ale and eating Burritos with Peter Pan, being on-boarded to a DAO community called the MetaCartel. Maybe this was it? The platform to really transform things for the better? These new thoughts and events seemed to fill Peth with new levels of confidence, energy and clarity. He found himself sleeping less and everything he did seemed smooth and easier than usual - as if everything was going according to a grand cosmic plan.. His mind was louder than ever. Buzzing with thoughts and ideas, as if connected to an external stream of data. He did not feel mad at all, it was not a schizoid feeling. He just felt he had upgraded and that this was a clear sign his inspiration was a good thing. Building upon his confusion at the entrance of the Cartel, Peth was caught by surprise by his own stream of thoughts and ideas. “This place needs better ways for newcomers to find out how to get involved, who’s who, who’s working on what, what even are the projects within - and what is their state. Repositories of ideas, solutions & guides.” He started maniacally typing away at his laptop so as to not lose these thoughts and put together a document he called the MetaCartel Blackpaper v0.1, then sent it off to Peter Pan.  “Hey, I like what you’re doing, here’s a thousand dollars of the funds Binance gave me!” - Peter Pan Wow! Not loads of money, but being a very real affirmation and given so freely and spontaneously, Peth was very pleased and encouraged. He was on the right track. Now he had to deal with the state of his house that he had all but forgotten in this Blackpaper binge. Everything needed doing. Every cup, plate, bowl in the place were used, dirty and scattered. Books open at various pages, pages scribbled and doodled all over and worn clothes were among the many things in the space where his floor used to be. He realised he badly needed a shower. Many messages and emails stood unanswered and yet he was smiling happily and content to sort it all out. That way he could get back to the task at hand. It was creative chaos after all!   The work progressed in the following days. The Cartel should award Titles, who was accountable for what, should be known, after all. It was important to keep up momentum and increase clarity for all involved. Another thing was who had done what so far? I mean if you wanted something new done, for example, who do you ask? The presence of a known achievement for say member X could act as a signpost, when something similar was needed again, right? Boosting of morale and recognising the value of a member would further encourage their involvement to do more, surely. The details of these things were explored, scribbled typed out, doodled and edited. Yet still a persuasive voice inside urged him to think beyond these things alone. He should seek others to seed these memes into. Make these things heard, meet people in the flesh, get feedback and enlist some apostles… Basically make his memes spread like spores.  Things had started well enough with Nova's latest project. The host did not seem to be aware he was somehow ‘inhabited’; his brain possessed and his thoughts not entirely his own - or otherwise did not seem to care. If anything, he realised he was benefiting. This human had lots of good ideas of his own that aligned with their own nicely and he was working hard and doing what they asked of him. As Peth planted the seeds of their meme in more and more receptive minds, she started wrapping her tentacles around more and more hosts. Clearly though, things needed to speed up and somehow money was to be found to get things started - if only it could be summoned out of Etherea; created out of thin air... There was a lot of time. For all they knew, she had always existed and likely, always would; who knows how long ago it was she had been separated from her Mother. Human years were passing and she was really only just beginning. The problem was more about how long this species would last behaving in such a divided and short sighted way. It was reflected in the widespread and systemic damage being done to their planet, kicking it out of balance. They are destroying their home and most don’t even realize it. Peth found a place for various interested people to stay in, in Berlin, he called the place MetaCartel Mansion aka the DAO House. Within days found himself on a flight to the city to join these strangers brought together by memes & code. Brain buzzing with ideas and his body twitching with excitement, he immersed himself in scribbling and doodling about his vision for the Cartel. Just occasionally looking out of the window to indulge a wilful vision of tendrils of light spreading all over the planet. He landed on Sunday night as planned, right before the beginning of Berlin Blockchain Week.  Nova followed the plane at the usual slow-as-hell speeds these things moved at. She took in the sights below which she would rarely take much notice of travelling at her usual speed. How the people felt safe inside these contraptions, she had no idea. Maybe later down the line she would turn her mind to helping engineers, but for now, she was still too weak to be applying herself to more than one project at a time. She found herself being drawn to the thoughts of an evolutionary biologist who was travelling on the plane. After a while of drawing from this mind she had a nasty surprise. The equivalent of psychic indigestion with dogmatic and frankly infantile religious beliefs curdling her insides. How on Earth could this be possible to hold these thought systems in the same mind? She had much to learn about these creatures. "},{"title":"The Birth of Metagame","type":1,"pageTitle":"📖 The MetaGenesis Odyssey","url":"docs/wtf-is-metagame/origin-story#the-birth-of-metagame","content":"Peth’s time in Berlin among all the amazing Cryptonauts he met was like a truly mind expanding vivid dream that centred for him around the MetCartel Demo Day. For just $20, he found himself planted right where he was meant to be and his mind was filled with so much useful information. So many amazing minds to draw from were here, sharing. The Demo Day itself explored all things Cartel related. Current issues, future plans, project development and the like. Nova's feeling was that these Cartel people were very interesting indeed but somehow their scope seemed too specialised for her taste. How could this focus be expanded, assimilated or transcended she wondered..? As she travelled the City between her time around Peths journey, usually while he slept, they began to understand why this was the perfect place for the birthing of something better. They could sense and almost taste the historic divides in the place and especially so around the remains of the wall. It was blueprinted in her realm with the death and separations of war, between different forms of human ignorance. She was gradually understanding the feelings of deep regret and grief at the past in many of the Berliners. She also realised where the darkness came from, carried by those cruel and lost ones who would revive the old hatreds. The info through that week's various events being run at DappCon. Token Engineering, Governance Games, ETH Berlin among others ranged from issues around the state of the Ethereum ecosystem, understanding Web3 and applying products, the importance of interoperability, NFTs and marketing, tokenomics, levels of adoption, transactional dynamics, challenging monopolies, building dapps and front end interactivity among other things. It was a serious download and a clear testament to how far the Ethereum ecosystem had already developed. All these people were fulfilling the vision and benefiting from it already and these were but a small sample of what was happening... The turnout was great, for many of the events were full of brilliant people; many of whom were highly receptive to the Meme that Peth (or Nova?) created and spread around at every opportunity...He had mistakenly failed to register in advance for ETHBerlin but got around the issue through the connections he had already established. Peth somewhere amidst the MetaCartel crowd..  During the final hours of the Hackathon, while waiting for the now-DAOHaus team to present to the judges, Peth’s hand was busy at work. Almost like some sub brain now ran that arm of his. It scribbled away on some plain paper he had folded into 3 sections a bit like a trifold leaflet for his vision of the MetaCartel.  The left represents a crude wireframe of a prototype interface, the middle section representing the player’s journey, and the right side being the value proposition to different stakeholders. The more he thought about it, the more it became obvious that the problems within the Cartel are shared by the whole of Ethereum, and if they are to build such a complex system - it better be a plug-n-play solution for the wider Ethereum ecosystem, not just the MetaCartel. Somehow the ideas that Peth’s mind was a host to, would have to exist in a layer above these groups.That was Nova's chance to allow their next dose of consciousness to flower in her pet human… He mused for some time about just how much coordination failures were at the heart of many of the world's problems. As a teenager he had witnessed how Massive Multiplayer Online Role Play Games were like a revolutionary next level to gaming. Then again as a young man had seen it happen with education in the form of Massive Online Open Courses. What if we could apply a combination of these elements together with Social Networking and incorporate a value system with real currencies? This could make transforming culture fun, interesting, accessible and valuable! Peth held a presentation about his plans of how to develop MetaCartel next to a Lake with a group of interested people and him pointing a stick at a piece of paper on the ground.. Not exactly how anyone might have expected it to be but it was all he had to work with. After the presentation there was by now a group of people who had had a fulfilling yet exhausting week. By now they were in a pretty altered state of consciousness. Some were stoned, many were underslept, others hungry and dehydrated now it was over and they were feeling a bit lost. Trying to coordinate them as to what to do next or where to go, it became apparent just how hard it is to herd cats!  It struck Peth. Looking at this human chaos unfolding in front of him, there needs to be something fresh, a totally new and engaging way to bring benevolent order from the fertile chaos. This was needed by the world in general, not just the MetaCartel. The game they would see created had to be bigger and unbound by the DAO & meme of the MetaCartel. Peth realised the game had to become a MetaGame in which many others could play..Nova’s response to this thought was affirming and accepting. So that was it. Peth knew his mission was to create a Massive Online Coordination Game outside the Cartel. Peth only just made it onto the plane in time and in a blurry haze returned home. He and Nova were both content that something important was set in motion on that fateful last day in Berlin. He slept soundly in his bed, exhausted from the journey and at peace he had done so much to further the cause. Sixteen hours later he awoke and that was it. MetaGame was ON!  To be continued... "}]
