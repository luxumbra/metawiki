This is still the most important raid. We’ve recently received a small grant from the MetaCartel &amp; have been pushing out updates. The latest version is live here.</li></ul><p>Discounting the fact that some of these things are still hardcoded, the live version is almost as good as the design demo we previewed 2 weeks ago.</p><p>We had a live raid yesterday; introducing new members to the codebase and the old ones to the latest changes, brainstorming &amp; co-hacking.</p><p>So yeah, the raid has been progressing pretty good &amp; the team has been growing. The basics are pretty much done and the design &amp; the Discord bot we’ll use for the guild pages are both coming along nicely.</p><ul><li><strong><em>🧠 MetaLibrary</em></strong>
It&#x27;s almost time to rebrand the wiki to the MetaLibrary - but not quite yet. To really make it into a MetaLibrary, we’ll need at least those “House of Ethereum”, “House of dApps”, “House of Tokens” &amp; “House of Defiance” posts.</li></ul><p>Why aren’t those new posts there already?
Well, because I have been revamping all the existing posts, writing the missing intro/onboarding pieces, and actually, spending ever more time inside DMs &amp; chat channels responding to people - which is kind of becoming my frustration, as already stated above. 😅</p><ul><li><strong><em>🌱 Seed Market 💸</em></strong>
I think it&#x27;s safe to say MetaGame’s liquidity problem has successfully been dealt with.</li></ul><p>Seed price: ~$43
Seed marketcap: ~$600k
In the liquidity pool: ~$74k
Treasury funds used? ~$2/30k</p><p>Frankly, the Seed market has been blowing up for the past few days. Though -50% from the all-time high of over $80, the Seed price seems to have somewhat stabilized at ~$40, which is still more than 4x just a week ago.</p><p>If you’ve been useful around MetaGame, you likely have a decent sum now 🙃</p><ul><li><strong><em>📻 MetaRadio</em></strong>
The new podcast episode is out!</li></ul><p>Autonomous Genesis - Real World DAOs &amp; Regenerative Economies</p><p>You might notice it&#x27;s called “Autonomous Genesis” and not “MetaView”. No, we haven’t rebranded the podcast - we launched a new podcast; two new podcasts to be more precise! 😱</p><p>You’re going to be funding 3 podcasts now? 👀</p><p>Not exactly, the idea with the Autonomous Podcast is that it will run &amp; pay itself. Each new guest will interview the next guest as well as pay for the production cost of the next episode.</p><p>The Autonomous Genesis will now branch into two podcast chains:</p><p>Autonomous A - fixing the world with technology.</p><p>Autonomous B - fixing the world with non-profits.</p><ul><li><strong><em>👕 MetaMerch</em></strong>
The store itself still isn’t up but we do have some fresh designs!</li></ul><p>Maybe start warming up for these drops?</p><p>&amp; last but not least…</p><ul><li><strong><em>💨 Website Migration!</em></strong>
We spent a lot of time building the profiles &amp; upgrading the wiki. It&#x27;s about time to start the integration process of moving everything into metagame.wtf.</li></ul><p>Here’s the latest design of the navigation bar/app drawer, closed &amp; open 👇</p><p>But what goes into all that background? 😱</p><p>You’ll know soon enough 🙃</p><p>Not just refusing to leak our alpha, we’re also not yet sure ourselves. We only know it will be some kind of a dashboard &amp; likely a feed.
We’ll be doing a design sprint with the folks over from Deep Work to work out which of the 100 awesome ideas we should build first.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="block-9"></a>📜Block #9<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#block-9" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><ul><li>We got invited to join the Panvala matching league!

Welcome, fam! ✌️</li><li>Following up on last week’s interview with Kevin, we started brainstorming on possible ways to collaborate. Something interesting might be brewing between Gitcoin &amp; MetaGame 🙃</li><li>Exciting news about the podcast itself coming in the next few days as well. The upcoming episode with Magenta of Bloom Network should air tomorrow, but the episode itself is kind of a beginning 👀</li><li>Jason Yin translates the wiki to Mandarin and kicks-off MetaGame China then brings in a bunch of students &amp; teachers with whom he is building a college for entrepreneurs in Beijing - hoping to integrate learnings from MetaGame 😱</li><li>The MyMeta funding proposal to the MetaCartel was a success! 💸 We’ll soon start using those funds to buy back Seeds from the builders and adding them to the liquidity pool! Good progress made on profiles themself.</li><li>Some of the notables reactivating or joining are Luke of 1Hive as a Patron, Vanmoortel as both a Patron &amp; an Inner Circle player &amp; Alec the latest high-skill builders but also a bunch of old hodlors checking-in &amp; adding liquidity.</li><li>MetaGame got listed on Coingecko &amp; Seeds had their first pump. 🤩 Currently sitting at $22, up from $18 yesterday, up from $9 on Wednesday, up from $6 since the pool launch - not bad.</li><li>Frens: dump the pump.</li></ul><p>Finally, as you might already be aware, Dunbar’s limit on Players was hit a while ago and we’ve been regularly cleaning the membership…
So far we’ve only kicked out ~20/150 people, but we’re currently 10 members over the cap due to the MetaGame China players &amp; the waitlist has gotten significantly longer yesterday. Expect the purges to accelerate. 😬</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="block-8"></a>📜Block #8<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#block-8" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><ul><li>The new podcast episode is live!

Surprisingly, nobody wants to sell their Seeds. Out of 12,295 Seeds minted for 55 people, only 2 people were willing to sell some. A grand total of 275 Seeds - 186 of which were picked up by an unknown address. 😅
This makes us both happy &amp; sad. Happy, because it shows that most of you still have faith in MetaGame. Sad, because it means we might have to mint Seeds for liquidity after all. Should we? (only players can access the linked channel)

Yessir!</li><li>And what have you done?
A major part of the first year was spent defining what exactly MetaGame is, what its goals are, what it requires on the technical side of things, and how it would actually work. It took a lot of talking &amp; a lot of writing it out.
We’re far from figuring everything out, but we’ve come far enough to have built up the knowledge base, set up the basic rewards &amp; economic system, built the first version of MyMeta, and prototyped MetaMaps &amp; MetaVille.
Other than figuring things out &amp; setting the foundations, I’d say most of the time was spent finding the right people and building the community. Could have gone the more traditional way of raising money &amp; offering paychecks, but by doing it this way we stayed true to our philosophy &amp; attracted the missionaries - not mercenaries.</li></ul><p>Alright, let’s get into some achievements:</p><ul><li>First presented on a crypto meetup (October 2019)</li><li>First raid party - seeding MetaGame cards (Devcon, October 2019)</li><li>First bots deployed (November 2019)</li><li>XP System implemented (SourceCred, December 2019)</li><li>First achievement NFTs minted (Mintbase, January 2020)</li><li>First website launched (February 2020)</li><li>First version of Interspace deployed (February 2020)</li><li>First presentation at a conference (ETHCC, March 2020)</li><li>First to do a virtual conference in the Ethereum space (InterCon, March 2020)</li><li>Seed Market launched (April 2020)</li><li>First life affected (May 2020)</li><li>Organized the first DAO hackathon (Fork The World, July 2020)</li><li>Reached Closed Beta (August 2020)</li><li>First version of MyMeta built (August 2020)</li><li>First version of MetaMaps built (August 2020)</li><li>Aaand some numbers up until now:</li></ul><p>Number #3 most funded in Gitcoin&#x27;s CLR round 4</p><ul><li>6 podcast episodes published</li><li>15 articles written</li><li>51 newsletters delivered</li><li>62 meetups held</li><li>137 registered contributors</li><li>217 contributors to our gitcoin grant</li><li>376 people receiving our newsletters</li><li>751 people on our discord</li><li>1062 people following us on Twitter</li><li>$20k+ raised in grants</li><li>$50k+ worth of Seeds minted</li><li>Over 9000 funs had</li></ul><p>I know you’re used to seeing bigger numbers from all of these shiny new defi platforms, but it’s a bit harder to attract the people &amp; capital when you’re not offering the prospects of getting rich quick 😅
Consider also that MetaGame was started by a one-man team, an ex-plumber-dude with no entrepreneurial experience - and it all makes more sense, doesn’t it? This dumbass had to spend the majority of his time convincing others that building MetaGame is worth their time.
To be fair, talented &amp; competent did join MetaGame, but the problem is that all of them have been working on it as a side thing. Unable to pay their bills, MetaGame can’t compete with their main focus of attention.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://wiki.metagame.wtf/admin#/?/docs/enter-metagame/Chainlog.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 40 40" style="margin-right:0.3em;vertical-align:sub"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col text--right"><em><small>Last updated on <time datetime="2021-01-05T02:50:26.000Z" class="docLastUpdatedAt_217_">05/01/2021</time> by <strong>Tyler</strong></small></em></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_3SO_"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#block-10" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #10</a></li><li><a href="#block-9" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #9</a></li><li><a href="#block-8" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #8</a></li><li><a href="#block-7" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #7</a></li><li><a href="#block-6" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #6</a></li><li><a href="#block-5" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #5</a></li><li><a href="#block-4" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #4</a></li><li><a href="#block-3" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #3</a></li><li><a href="#block-2" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #2</a></li><li><a href="#block-1" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Block #1</a></li><li><a href="#genesis-block" class="table-of-contents__link">📜Genesis Block</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
